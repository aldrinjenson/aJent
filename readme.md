This project was made as a prototype to explore GPT agents.
Currently custom functions have been added to add and manipulate todo information.
The aJent will intelligently decide when to use what functionality - hence being a smart and powerful assistant!

## Features

- **Local File System Interaction:** Execute bash commands to interact with the local file system effortlessly.

- **Web Browsing Capability:** Retrieve relevant information from the internet whenever needed.

- **Wikipedia based Q&A Answering:** Retrieve relevant information from wikipedia whenever needed.

- **Conversational Memory:** Remember past interactions with aJent, allowing for a more personalized experience.

- **Custom GPT Functionality:** Utilize openAI based functions to add even more custom functionalities to add more custom actions like managing todos.


## Technologies Used

- **LangChain:** for LLM orchestration
- **Streamlit:** Building the user interface for aJent's seamless interaction.
- **OpenAI:** Currently it's based on OpenAI API since it uses function calling. But this can be easily swapped with most popular LLMs
